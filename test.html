            window.innerHeight ); //using the size of the window is the best practice usually
                //for performance heavy apps we could use smaller values like window.innerWidth/2 and window.innerHeight/2, which would render the app at quarter the size, and adding a (,false) will render it at half resolution

            const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00} );//we also need a material to colour/cover it, for this example were using MeshBasicMaterial and the color green

            scene.add( cube );//finally this adds this brings everything by default to (0,0,0)
